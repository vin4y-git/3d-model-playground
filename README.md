# 3D Model Playground

Control 3D models using hand gestures and voice commands in real-time.

An interactive web app built with threejs, mediapipe computer vision, web speech API, and rosebud AI.

- Say "drag", "rotate", "scale", or "animate" to change the interaction mode
- Pinch fingers to control the 3D model
- Drag/drop a new 3D model onto the page to import it (GLTF format only for now)

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Camera / microphone access

## Technologies

- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and gesture recognition
- **Web Speech API** for speech recognition
- **HTML5 Canvas** for visual feedback
- **JavaScript** for real-time interaction

## Setup for Development

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/collidingScopes/3d-model-playground

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 3d-model-playground

If you found this tool useful, feel free to buy me a coffee. 

My name is Alan, and I enjoy building open source software for computer vision, games, and more. This would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!
